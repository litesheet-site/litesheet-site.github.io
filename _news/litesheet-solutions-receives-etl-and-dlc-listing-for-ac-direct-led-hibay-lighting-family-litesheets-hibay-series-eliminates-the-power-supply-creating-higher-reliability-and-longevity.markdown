LiteSheet Solutions (‘LiteSheet’) newly released Hibay Series (‘BHBC’) is curved in its design and embedded with patented BriteCor Technology. This AC direct LED fixture requires no power supply and utilizes 50% less energy than fluorescent or traditional HID high bay lighting. LiteSheet has become the leader and authority for innovative light design proven by having just received TechEDGE’s 2016 Innovator of the Year Award.

The BHBC is built with a precision formed reflector system, which maximizes lighting output for ranges from 15 feet to over 40 feet high making it ideal for warehouses, manufacturing plants, sports facilities and retail spaces. The fixture is most sought after for its high reliability, efficiency and 0-10V continuous dimming capabilities over existing wiring. Additional options also include, wire-guard, lens, occupancy sensor and daylight sensor.

LiteSheet’s CEO, Roger Whyte, states “We have made incredible strides across 2016 in product development and the BHBC makes me especially proud given its flexibility and the fact that it defies current efficiency standards.”

LiteSheet has seen a 45% increase in purchase orders in the past 30 days with the announcement of BHBC. Several large-end, national facilities and 6 major sports arenas have made initial commitments to install. All LiteSheet products are available with warranties for up to 15 years, fully patented and are proudly manufactured in the USA.
