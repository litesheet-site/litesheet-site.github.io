The BHBC is a high efficiency premier high bay fixture engineered for premium performance. A precision-formed reflector system available in enhanced white reflector is designed to achieve maximum light output for ceilings from 15 feet to 40 feet. Based on ceiling height, these fixtures can replace a fluorescent or traditional HID high bay while using up to 50% less energy.

The BHBC High Bay Series features the patented BriteCor™ technology. The AC direct BriteCor light engine does not require a DC power supply.

The BHBC Series is certified for use in new and retrofit applications and is available in 2’x2′ and 2’x4′ sizes.
