questions:
- question: Will your LED troffer kit work with existing dimming systems? Off/on &
    0-10v?
  answer: No, currently LiteSheet fixtures are approved for on/off states. There is
    a slider wall switch in the process of UL approval but 0-10V support is still
    in development.
- question: Which control brands/ companies  will your 2x4 & 2x2 LED interface with?
  answer: LiteSheet light fixtures will work with all on/off power switches on the
    market.  R&D is working on options to support dimming through 0-10V operation.
- question: "Will your troffer line , high bay & vapor type fixtures operate with
    Daylight Harvest \nSystems?"
  answer: No, at this time, only on/off occupancy and control is supported by LiteSheet
    light fixtures.
- question: Is your Vapor Tight line NSF Certified?
  answer: The BVT Vaportight is rated NEMA 4X, IP67 and IP68 but it is not NSF certified.
- question: Can your troffer be controlled using cell phone?
  answer: Using a Belkin Wemo or other 3rd party on/off solution, LiteSheet lights
    can be controlled using a cell phone.
- question: Can your products be integrated with an existing Energy Management System?
  answer: LiteSheet lights are RF silent and do not cause interference on the electrical
    line. They will not interfere with power measurement or switching so they should
    be compatible with any system that turns lights on and off by switching power
    to the light.
- question: What does “Adaptive AC Direct” mean?
  answer: The technology used in the LiteSheet light engine does not use a power supply
    - the LEDs are driven directly from the AC line with minimal circuitry in the
    engine.  The LED board uses a unique mesh of components that will automatically
    increase the light output if individual LED chips fail. The combination of the
    driverless engine and automatic compensation for lost components is Adaptive AC
    Direct.
