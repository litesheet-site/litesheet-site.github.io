questions:
- question: Will your LED troffer kit work with existing dimming systems? Off/on &
    0-10v?
  answer: No, currently LiteSheet fixtures are approved for on/off states. There is
    a slider wall switch in the process of UL approval but 0-10V support is still
    in development.
- question: Which control brands/ companies  will your 2x4 & 2x2 LED interface with?
  answer: LiteSheet light fixtures will work with all on/off power switches on the
    market.  R&D is working on options to support dimming through 0-10V operation.
