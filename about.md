<h3>THE LITESHEET MISSION</h3>
<p>
	To deliver innovative, efficient, sustainable, cost-effective lighting solutions to our customers. 
	We accomplish this mission with integrity, honesty, respect and commitment to excellence in all that we do.
</p>

<h3>OUR PROCESS</h3>
<p>
	BRILLIANCE THROUGH SIMPLICITY is our culture. It is how we design our products, manage customer service and 
	communicate to our consumer. It is the common thread through everything that we do. We believe that great 
	products donâ€™t have to be complicated, which is why we removed the driver from our light engine and created 
	BriteCor. By eliminating failure points and running on an AC Direct circuit, we delivered more reliable and 
	efficient lighting to the marketplace.
</p>

<h3>OUR TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<p>
	BriteCor is an industry shifting patented technology that eliminates points of failure and has paved the way 
	towards AC Direct innovation. The AC current powers the driver and mesh components, making LiteSheet products
	 modular and scalable. The Adaptive Control Module removes the power supply and made possible the first ever 
	 driverless technology. The current technology is highly efficient and produces over 150 lumens per watt. 
	 BriteCor also balances light voltage and eliminates expected degradation.
