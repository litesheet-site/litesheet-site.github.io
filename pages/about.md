title: About Us
permalink: "/about/"
mission: To deliver innovative, efficient, sustainable, cost-effective lighting solutions
  to our customers. We accomplish this mission with integrity, honesty, respect and
  commitment to excellence in all that we do.
philosophy:
- title: Mission Led
  content: LiteSheet products are patented, DLC and ETL listed.  Their patented technology
    is 75% more efficient than competitive products. We also offer an industry leading
    warranty policy.
- title: American Manufactured
  content: Based in Forest, VA, LiteSheet is manufactured in the USA and has been
    tested for the highest elimination of Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) against
    its competitors.
- title: Servant Leadership
  content: We put our customer first.  You are our partner and first priority.  We
    offer a standard 15-year warranty to prove that we are committed to our products
    and stand by its quality.
process: BRILLIANCE THROUGH SIMPLICITY is our culture. It is how we design our products,
  manage customer service and communicate to our consumer. It is the common thread
  through everything that we do. We believe that great products donâ€™t have to be complicated,
  which is why we removed the driver from our light engine and created BriteCor. By
  eliminating failure points and running on an AC Direct circuit, we delivered more
  reliable and efficient lighting to the marketplace.
technology: BriteCor is an industry shifting patented technology that eliminates points
  of failure and has paved the way towards AC Direct innovation. The AC current powers
  the driver and mesh components, making LiteSheet products modular and scalable.
  The Adaptive Control Module removes the power supply and made possible the first
  ever driverless technology. The current technology is highly efficient and produces
  over 150 lumens per watt. BriteCor also balances light voltage and eliminates expected
  degradation.
